the 108 Principles of Emma Dearborn’s Speedwriting

Here are the 108 numbered Principles that are taught in the 1930 textbook, combined with a few more elements of the system that are apparent in the example texts and in the Speedwriting Dictionary.

Rather than presenting the Principles in numerical order I’ve grouped them into categories. I’ve re-worded almost all of them and selected some different examples in hopes that an alternative expression of these concepts might help to clarify our view of the system.

## Punctuation

(5) A declarative sentence ends with a period. (There is no need to type a space after the period.)

(10) An interrogative sentence ends with a question mark. (There is no need to type a space after the question mark.)

(62) Indicate the end of a paragraph by repeating the period or question mark at the end of the final sentence.

(98) To indicate a correction or addition within a text, use three diagonal slashes ( /// ) at the beginning of the new or corrected material and three slashes at the end of it.

Note: The first letter of a sentence is not automatically capitalized in Speedwriting. Upper-case letters are reserved for use as symbols that represent various prefixes, suffixes and sound-clusters.

Note: In most shorthand systems, commas are almost never used. Context makes it clear where commas would be inserted when transcribing the notes therefore writing commas in the shorthand would be a waste of time. In Speedwriting commas are used as symbols representing certain sounds so using the comma as a punctuation mark is impossible.
Phonetics

## Primary Principles

(1) Omit all of the silent letters.

fo = foe    
hi = high    

(8) Ignore the irrational spelling in words like “try, few, sleigh” and write what you hear: tri, fu, sla. (But be aware that a very small number of common words such as to and do keep their irrational spellings and are not written phonetically.)

nu = new / knew    
wa = way / weigh

(32) “Write only as much of a word as is necessary to suggest the word.” This is the Principle that was used to design the arbitrary abbreviations for some common words.

tog = together    
ll = little

(00) The unwritten rule: Medial vowels are usually omitted. (”Medial vowels” means those which are sandwiched in between consonants.) There are some common, short words in which a “long” vowel is written but the final consonant is dropped.

kt = cot          ko = coat    
fn = fin          fi = fine    
spk = speck       spe = speak

Consonants

(2) When c has the sound of k, write the letter k.

kw = cow    
ak = ache    

(3) Write t to express “to” only in infinitive verbs and connect the t to the verb. In other situations “to” is written as to

ilk tri th wa. = I like to write this way.    
lugo to ta lby? = Will you go to that library?

(7) Write the letter c to express the “ch” sound.

ec = each    
cu = chew

(16) The letter n is generally omitted when writing the “ng” sound as in “long” and “ring.”

blg = belong    
sg = sing

(20) In most cases the letter t is used to express the sound of “th.” There are a few exceptions to make short words more legible, such as bath > bth but derivatives of those words drop the h as shown in the examples below.

tro = throw    
trml = thermal    
bth = bath             btrb = bathrobe    
mth = myth             mtK = mythical

(21) When “-se” has the sound of “z” at the end of a root-word, write z

cz = choose    
nz = nose    

(28) Write upper-case Z to express the “sh” sound.

Zo = show    
wZ = wish

Frequent Consonant Combinations

(26) Write a diagonal slash mark ( / ) to express “rd” or “rt”

b/ = bird    
sq/ = squirt

(29) Use a hyphen to express “nd” or “nt” or “ment” at the end of a syllable.

rp- = repent    
df- = defend    
df-- = defendant    
bs- = basement

(30) Write the letter q to express the “nk” sound at the end of a syllable.

skq = skunk    
iq = ink

Vowels and Diphthongs

(6) Write the letter w to express the “ow” sound in the middle or at the end of a word.

klwt = clout    
hwl = howl    
nw = now

(15) Write a comma to express the medial or final sound of the “ee” vowel when it is spelled in longhand with -y, -ie, -ey etc. However, be aware that words ending with suffixes like -ary and -ity are written according to different Principles.

bb, = baby    
kk, = cookie    
mn, = money

(22) Write the letter y to express the “oi/oy” sound.

byl = boil    
jy = joy

(36) Write the letter a for the sound of “aw” in “lawn” and “au” in “caught.” However, write the letter o for the same/similar sound if it is spelled with o in longhand.

la = law    
ot = ought    
ang = awning    
omlt = omelet

Phrasing

Groups of words— especially short, common words— may be written together without spaces between them. This process is called phrasing. It increases the speed of writing/typing but makes reading the notes more difficult.

An unnumbered Principle from the textbook Foreword: “The beginner will find it best to make short phrases at first for that will make for ease in reading as well as writing.”

(4) When “as” is repeated in a phrase, omit the letter a from “as.”

slgs = as long as    
sbgs = as big as

(12) Omit the word “and” from common phrases like “over and over” and “again and again.”

agag = again and again    
LoLo = lower and lower

(72) Proper nouns (the names of people and places) should be separated from other words in a sentence. Do not phrase them.
Word-building Rules

(11) A “word-sign” is a pre-determined abbreviation for a common word. Whenever two word-signs or a word-sign and another syllable can be combined to express another word, you should do so.

trf   =  tr + f   =  therefore    
wkpl  =  wk + pl  =  workplace    
dti   =  d + ti   =  daytime

(13) Write numerals (digits) to express all numbers except for “one.” The Speedwriting Dictionary seems to contradict this textbook Principle by listing ways to spell out the numbers, for example svntnt for “seventeenth” nnt, for “ninety.”

onwa st = one-way street    
nad or 2 = in a day or two    

(18) The past tense -ed and the present participle -ing are simply omitted from verbs in most cases. Context makes the verb’s tense or aspect clear and including the d or g in the shorthand code might actually make it more likely to be misinterpreted as some entirely different word.

iv wk he bf. = I have worked here before.    
ru do l? = Are you doing well?

The 1927 multi-volume edition of the textbook offered some examples of when to include d to indicate the past tense or g to indicate the -ing participle. Here are updated versions of those examples:

wk s g f u. = Work is good for you.    
wkg s g f u. = Working is good for you.    
-    
tgf u rse as aci ul nv fgt.    
     = The gift you receive as a child you will never forget.    
tgf u rsed as aci ul nv fgt.    
     = The gift you received as a child you will never forget.    
tgf uv rse as aci ul nv fgt.    
     = The gift you have received as a child you will never forget.

(27) To add -s (plural or present tense suffix) to a shorthand word that ends with a punctuation symbol, repeat that symbol.

k/ = card              k// = cards    
t- = tent              t-- = tents    
kl' = class            kl'' = classes

(35) Use ‘standard abbreviations‘ whenever you can: co for “company,” NY for “New York,” etc.

The textbook uses the old-fashioned abbreviation no for the word “number.” If you would prefer to write that word according to normal Principles, you would write Nmb

The Speedwriting Dictionary offers write-by-Principle alternatives for many of the abbreviations used in the textbook. For example, the dictionary indicates that “city” may be written phonetically as s; or using the textbook abbreviation of C
Frequent Word-endings

Most of the Speedwriting word-endings are presented in the final section of this document. The word-endings listed here are used so often that it is advisable to introduce them now so you can appreciate the example words in the following sections.

(9) Write the letter l to express the word-endings -ly and -ily. The textbook also mentions -ley but this is rarely used apart from arbitrary word-sign for “valley.”

nel = nearly    
hpl = happily    
fml = family    
hml = homily

(14) Write the letter g to express the word-endings -ing and -thing.

nog = knowing    
utqg = unthinking    
n,g = anything    
evg = everything

(47) Write the letter y to represent medial or final -ary, -ery, -iry, -ory, -ury (and sometimes variations such as -airy and -ari-).

fy = fairy             nfyx = nefarious    
flty = flattery        sjy = surgery    
sy = sorry             glyx = glorious    
wy = wiry              hy = hurry

(48) The letter x expresses medial or final -us, -ous, -eous, -ius, -ious, -cious, -tious.

bnx = bonus            jlx = jealous    
gsx = gaseous          rdx = radius    
rljx = religious       dlx = delicious    
mbx = ambitious        rpx = rapacious

(49) The letter x can also express final -cial, -acial, -sual, -tial, -atial. There are very few cases in which this causes ambiguity; there just aren’t many root-words that are equally likely to adopt -tious or -tial as a termination.

glx = glacial          plx = palatial    
vx = visual            kx = casual    
max = martial          spx = special

(50) The letter f represents medial and final -ful, -fully, -fere, -fore, -fy. See also Principle 76.

a/f = artful / artfully    
rgtf = regretful / regretfully
Nf = interfere    
bf = before    
rtf = ratify

(51) The letter j expresses medial and final -tion, -ation, -ician, -otion, -usion. (The textbook also lists -etion with the example vnj “Venetian,” but most -etion words in the dictionary are written with ej as seen in “depletion.”)

akj = action           rlj = relation           
kdj = condition        mjj = magician    
pmj = promotion        kfj = confusion        
dpej = depletion

(100) la represents the word-endings -late, -alate, -elate, -ellate, -ilate, -olate, -ulate.

nfla = inflate         skla = escalate      
rla = relate           apla = appellate    
dla = dilate           pkla = percolate    
tbla = tabulate

Special Phoneme Clusters

Capitalize to Indicate an -er Syllable

(24) Capitalize the first syllable of the root-word to indicate that it is followed by a sound (usually a syllable) such as -er, -der, -ter or -ther. This is one of the most unique Principles of Speedwriting and it is often misunderstood by visitors who are merely glancing at the rules in a shallow manner.

The word “author” can be written with the single letter A because lower-case a represents the ah/aw/au sound at the beginning, and capitalizing the letter represents the thor syllable at the end!

lo = low               or = or    
Lo = lower             Or = order    
byl = boil             Wa = water    
Byl = boiler           A = author

Note: Because the symbol for the “sh” sound (Z) is already an uppercase letter, words that begin with “sh” cannot use Principle 24.

Zv = shave             Zvr = shaver    
Zu = shoot             Zur = shooter

Symbols for Various Sound Clusters

(38) Write an upper-case S to express the sound of str- and also to express syllables like ‘ster, stir, stur.’

Sa = stray    
mnS = monster    
kSnj = consternation    
rSj = restoration

(23) Write a comma to express the “st” sound at the end of a word.

bl, = blast    
fmo, = foremost

(43) Write the letter s to express “st” in the middle of a word.

ds- = distant    
psl = pistol

Note on the application of Principles 15, 23 and 43: In “thirst” and “yeast” the comma represents the final “st.” In “thirsty” and “yeasty,” the “st” is considered medial rather than final, so it is written with s and the comma represents the “ee” sound at the end of the word.

th,  =  thirst
ths, =  thirsty
y,   =  yeast
ys,  =  yeasty

(76) Write the letter f to express the syllable -for-, -fer-

rfmj = reformation    
mtf = metaphor    
Tf = transfer    
fv- = fervent

(79) Write the letter x to express -aks-, -ex- or -ox-

xd- = accident    
x, = exist    
xjn = oxygen    
txkol = toxicology

(106) Write Me to express -meter- or -metri- / -metro-

Mek = metric    
klMe = kilometer    
Meno = metronome

Omitting Letters from Selected Sound Clusters

(44) The letter n is omitted when it is followed immediately by -cial, -ch, -j, -shun. Principles 44 and 37a both govern words ending in -nans, -nens, etc.

fnx = financial        cj = change      
trc = trench           kvj = convention    
ord/ = ordinance       mnc/ = eminence  

(45) The letter t is omitted after the sound of k, p, x.

lku = lecture    
rp = rapt   
mxu = mixture

(101) Omit the letter d when it occurs right before j, m, v.

ajq = adjunct    
amj = admission    
av-u = adventure    

(94) In words of more than one syllable, write the following abbreviations of initial sounds:

b to represent “br”
f to represent “fr”
g to represent “gr”
k to represent “cr/kr”
t to represent “tr”
h to represent “hor-”

bv; = brevity          bgde = brigadier
